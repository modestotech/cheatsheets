Handled as a shell script inside the main shell script 

Functions
- Declare 
- Use 
- Return data
- Export

sum() {
  echo $(( $1 + $2 ))
}

Another option is to use the return keyword, but that's not a good option in Bash as it can only hold exit status (value between 0-255, where "0" means success). When using return the value returned ends up in $?. 

Redirection of function body output (into standard error in this case)
function () {
} >&2

Common pitfall: a command in a pipeline runs in a subshell
