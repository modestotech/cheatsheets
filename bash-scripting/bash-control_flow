Classic for loop

	# code to be repeated
done

C-style for loop

case WORD in
	PATTERN1)
		# code for pattern 1
	PATTERN2)
		# code for pattern 2
	...

Compound commands 
{ cmd1; cmd2; cmd3; } # Executes next always 

Ampersand and two pipes work as shorthand if statements 
{ cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3; } # Executes next if the previous reported success
{ cmd1 || cmd2 || cmd3; } # Executes next if the previous reported failure
